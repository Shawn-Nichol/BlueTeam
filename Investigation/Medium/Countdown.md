# Quesiton 2
Open Autopsy and check the following locations for communication programs
- Installed programs, but nothing is in this folder. 
- Web download: there is nothing of note in this folder.
- Web search shows a search for "Signal download." 

With a quick look in the Windows prefetch folder, we can see  the signal application has been run. 
```

A Google search for Signal Decryption should return this handy page from Bleeping Computers. This page provides details on where the encryption key and database are stored. 
- Encryption Key: %AppData%\Signal\config.json
- Database: %AppData%\Roaming\Signal\sql\db.sqlit
https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/signal-desktop-leaves-message-decryption-key-in-plain-sight/

The article states that Singal stores the encryption key in plain text in the %AppData%\Signal\config.json

# Question 6 
The hint tells you to look at Thumbcache_256.db in the /img_Zerry.E01/vol_vol3/ZerryDüí£üî•/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Explorer/.
