# Threat Intelligence
Threat Intelligence is information that an organization uses to understand the threats currently targeting them, or could target them, or could target them in the future. This knowldege can help security teams to develop better defenses, mitigate cyber risk, and aid with monitoring their networks for any signs of compromise so that teams can remove malicious actors as quickly as possible. 

Threat Intelligence aims to provide information on more sophisticated threats, such as APT, Zero-day vulnerabilities, and global malware campaigns. This helps organizations understand who is attacking them, why they're doing it, and the tactics they use so they can be replicated in penetration tests and red team engagements or defensive measures put in place to stop or slow them down. 

Intelligence is shared in the form of IOC, which are artifacts observed about malicious activity. These could be an email address, IP, websites, or file base artifacts such as file name, file size, or hash value. 

# Threat Intelligence lifecycle
It is all about gathering raw data and transforming it into valuable intelligence. 

**1) Planning & Direction**
Goals need to be set, and stakeholders need to be clearly defined; this helps the project stay on track and not waste time or resources working on intelligence that is not important. 

**2) Collection**
This is the stage where the team will go out and collect all the data they need to create actionable intelligence. 

**3) Processing**
Now that the team has collected data, they need to transform it into a clear and readable format so that it can be analyzed. 

**4) Analysis**
Humans processed information is turned into actionable intelligence that can be used. Depending on the circumstances, the decisions might involve whether to investigate a potential threat, what actions to take immediately to block an attack, how to strengthen security controls, or how much investment in additional security resources is justified. 

**5) Dissemination**
Dissemination involves getting the finished intelligence output to where it needs to go. 

Ask the following
- What threat intelligence do they need, and how can external information support their activities?
- How should the intelligence be presented to make it understandable and actionable for that audience?
- How often should we provide updates and  other information?
- Through what media should the intelligence be disseminated?
- How should we follow up if they have questions?

**6) Feedback**
Understand your overall intelligence priorities and the requirements of the security teams that will be consuming the threat intelligence. 
- What types of data to collect
- How to process and enrich the data to turn it into useful information
- How to analyze the information and present it as actionable intelligence
- To whom must each type of intelligence be disseminated, how quickly does it need to be disseminated, and how fast does it respond to questions?
