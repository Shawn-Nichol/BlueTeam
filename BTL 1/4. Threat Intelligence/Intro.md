# Threat Intellignece
Threat Intelligence is informatino that an organization uses to understand the threats that are currently targeting them, or could target them, or could target them in the future. This knowldege can help security teams to develop better defenses, mitigate cyber risk, and aid with monitoring their networks for any signs of compromise, so teams can remove malicious actors as quickly as possible. 

Threat Intelligence aims to provide informatino on more sophisticated threats, such as APT, Zero-day vullnerabilities, and global malware campaigns. This helps organization understand who is attacking them, why they're doing it, and the tactics they use so they can be replicated in penetration tests and red teams engagements, or defensive measures put in place to stop or slow them down. 

Intelligence is shared in the form of IOC, which are artifacts that have been observed in relation to malicious activity. These could be email address, IP, websites, or file base arifacts such as file name, file siZe, or its hash value. 

# Threat Inelligence lifecycle
Is all about gathering raw data and transforming it into intelligence that has value. 

**1) Planning & Direction**
Goals need to be set and stakeholders need to be clearly defined, this helps the project stay on track, and not waste time or resources working on itelligence taht is nto important. 

**2) Collection**
This is the stage where the team will go  out and collect all of the data they need to achieve their goal fo creating actinoable intelligence. 

**3) Processing**
Now that the team has collected data, they need to transform it into a clear and readable format so that it can be analyzed. 

**4) Analysis**
Humans process information is turned into actionable intelligence that can be used. Depending on the circumstances, the decions might involve whether to investigate a potentail threat, what actions to take immediately to block an attack, how to strengthen security controls, or how much investment in addtional security resources is justified. 

**5) Dissemination**
Disssemination involves gettting the finished intelligence output to the places it needs to go. 

Ask the following
- what Threat intelligence do they need, an d how can external information suppport their activities?
- How should the intelligence be presented to make it easily understandable and actionable for that audience?
- How often should we provide updates and  other information?
- Through what media should the intelligence be dissimentated?
- How should we follow up  if they have questions?

**6) Feedback**
Understand you overall intelligence priorities and the requirements of the security teams that will be consuming the threat intelligence. 
- What types of data to collect
- How to process an enrich the data to turn it into useful information
- How to analyze the information and present ti as actionable intelligence
- To whom each type of intelligence must be disseminated, how quickly it needs to be disseminated and how fasted to responed to questions.
