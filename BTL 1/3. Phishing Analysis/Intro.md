Emails are comprised of two parts header and Body. 

# Header
A header is a set of lines containing ifnormation about the message's transportation, such as the sender's address, the recipient's address, or timestamps showing when the messagw was sent by intermediary servers to the transport agents(MTA), which act as mail sorting office. The header begins with the From line and is changed each time it passes through an intermediary server. Using headers, you can see the esact path taken by the email and how lon git took each server to process.
