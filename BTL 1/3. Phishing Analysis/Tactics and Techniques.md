# Spear phishing
When malicious actors gather information about their target to make their emails more effective. Tailoring an email to a specific target makes the message more convincing. 




# Impersonating
The act of pretending to be someone else. This can be used to tick malicious actors to trick their target into thinking they are someone they know, making them more likely to interact. 

# Typo Squatting
Typo squatting is the act of impersonating a brand or domain name by misspelling it, such as missing letters or including additional ones. 

Large organizations may choose to generate a list of similarly named domains, and either use a monitoring solution to see if someone has registered any of them, or they can pay the cost to register them under the business name, 

# Homographs
A homograph phishing attack is virtually impossible for users to spot. This attack exploits the fact that many different characters look exactly alike. These characters are called homographs, and the problem is with how the characters are encoded using Unicode. 

Similar-looking characters such as Greek O, Latin O, and Cyrillic O were not assigned the same code. So the Latin o and the Cryill o have different Unicode and are, therefore, different letters. I also mean domains with those different Os are different domains. 


# Sender spoofing
Is the process of making the sending address in an email the same as a legitimate email to make the recipients believe it is coming from a genuine sender? This is typically used with credential harvesters where the attacker wants the recipient to believe the email has actually come from the impersonated company 

The malicious actors send an email with a "From:" address that appears to be from a source the recipient trusts, such as a well-known brand, work colleague, or family member. 


# HTML Styling
HTML Tyling is where code and images are used to style an email. This is used by legitimate emails to provide a more visually attractive design, making the email appear more professional. HTML styling is typically observed with credential harvesters, as they are trying to impersonate an organization. 

- Non-malicious files that are used for social engineering
- Non-malicious files that have malicious hyperlinks

**Social Engineering files**


**Lure Documents**
Inserting hyperlinks into a malicious email is common and can potentially be detected easily by email security tools that retrieve URLS and sandbox them to see if the destination is malicious or has a bad community reputation. A way to prevent this is by including the hyperlink in a document, such as a PDF or MS Word file. This means that the attachment itself isn't inherently malicious, but the hyperlink inside can be. 

**Malicious Files**
The most common form of inherently malicious files in MS Office documents is utilizing macros to run malicious code on the system that opens the document. They can download additional malware to the system by reaching out to the domains on the internet, retrieving files, and executing them. 


## Hyperlinks
A hyperlink is a webpage URL that is embedded into text, a button or an image.  


## URL Shorteners
A tactic for disguising malicious URLs, and preventing some aspects of automated security analysis is the use of URL shortening services such as Bitly and Short URL. 

## Business Email Compromise
A Business Email Compromise is a phishing attack that can target any organization but focuses on those that are likely to transfer large amounts of money to either purchase goods or pay other parties, such as vendors. The malicious actor will monitor their target over a period of time to determine which companies the organization pays, and when they have found a relationship between the company and a supplier, they will either compromise an email account belonging to a member of the executive board or a high-level employee, or spoof the address so it appears legitimate, and will instead direct the relevant employess to transfer the money to a different bank account that is under the malicious actor's control. This may seem like an easy attack to spot, but it works. Business email compromise attacks accounted for an estimated 1.77
