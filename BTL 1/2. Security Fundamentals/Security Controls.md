Security controls are fall in two three groups, Techincal, Administrative, and Physical. 

# Physical Seecurity Controls (Deterrents, access controls, monitoring controls)
Phiscial secruity controls are used to prevent unauthorized access to a building, or areas within. These controls help to make intrustion as hard possible. The three main controls are deterrents, monitoring controls, and access controls. 

Ex.  Locked doors, security guards, CCTV, and barriers. 


Access controls can make it hard for unauthorized indivduals to gain access to protected areas. 

Monitoring Controls such as CCTV are useful for live monitoring and keeping a record of any malicious behavior so that it can be used in the event of prosecution. 

Deterrents are designed to deter people. 


# Network Security Controls (Firewalls, NIPS, NIDS, SIEM, NAC)

# Endpoint Security Controls (HIPS, HIDS, EDR, Anti-Virus, SIEM)







# Email Security controls (Spam filters, DLP, email scanning)

## Data Loss Prevention**
data leak prevention is a security control that works to prevent sensitive buiness or personal inforamtion from leaving the organization in an unuathorized manner. THis data can be categorized as files, banking information, account credentials, or PII; for the purpose of this module, we are focusing on the application of DLP technologies to  email communication


Phising is the number one attack vector for compromsing organizations, leading to data brteaches.

**Spam Filter** A spam filter is a piece of software that scans incoming emails to see if they have telltale signs of spam or malicious emails and prevents them from being delivered to employee mailboxes so that they don't fill up with junk or dangerous messages. 

DLP can monitor emails at different levels: 
- email body content
- email headers
- email attachments of various types.

**Email Scanning**
Typically phising emails will contain either a malicious URL or Attachment, specially designed scanners will read the email header and body, and work to identify malicious indicators either using patterns or signatures, or blacklists of known malicious email senders, hashes and domain names. When a suspisious email is detected it is quarantined.
