Security controls fall into three groups: Technical, Administrative, and Physical. 

# Physical security controls (Deterrents, access controls, monitoring controls)
Physical security controls prevent unauthorized access to a building or areas within. These controls help to make intrusion as hard as possible. The three main controls are deterrents, monitoring controls, and access controls. 

Ex.  Locked doors, security guards, CCTV, and barriers. 


Access controls can make it hard for unauthorized individuals to access protected areas. 

Monitoring Controls such as CCTV are useful for live monitoring and keeping a record of any malicious behavior so that it can be used in the event of prosecution. 

Deterrents are designed to deter people. 


# Network Security Controls (Firewalls, NIPS, NIDS, SIEM, NAC)

# Endpoint Security Controls (HIPS, HIDS, EDR, Anti-Virus, SIEM)







# Email Security controls (Spam filters, DLP, email scanning)

## Data Loss Prevention**
data leak prevention is a security control that prevents sensitive business or personal information from leaving the organization in an unauthorized manner. This data can be categorized as files, banking information, account credentials, or PII; for the purpose of this module, we are focusing on the application of DLP technologies to  email communication


Phishing is the number one attack vector for compromising organizations, leading to data breaches.

**Spam Filter** A spam filter is software that scans incoming emails to see if they have telltale signs of spam or malicious emails and prevents them from being delivered to employee mailboxes so that they don't fill up with junk or dangerous messages. 

DLP can monitor emails at different levels: 
- email body content
- email headers
- email attachments of various types.

**Email Scanning**
Typically phishing emails will contain either a malicious URL or Attachment; specially designed scanners will read the email header and body and work to identify malicious indicators either using patterns or signatures or blacklists of known malicious email senders, hashes, and domain names. When a suspicious email is detected, it is quarantined. 

**Security Awareness Training**
Security awareness training should be a mandatory program that new employees must complete, as we
