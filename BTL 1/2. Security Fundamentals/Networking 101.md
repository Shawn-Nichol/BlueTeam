# OSI Model

### Application
One of two layers users interact with. The application layer is in charge of providing an interface to the user to interact, communicate, and even give commands to the computer. 

HTTP, SMTP

### Presentation
This layer is considered the translator between the machine and the user. Guarantees that the data is understandable for the applications that will be operated by the user, allowing its correct visualization. It is also responsible for the encryption and decryption of incoming and outgoing data. 


### Session
Is responsible for managing sessions between machines to enable communication between them. It is responsible for opening, closing, and resetting sessions and is in charge of establishing the order of communication between a sender and a receiver, among many other activities of this nature. 



### Transport
The transport layer is responsible for transparent data transfer between two computers. It assembles and fragments the packets that will be sent in the communication while providing different mechanisms for verifying the integrity to ensure that the information reaches the system accurately. 


### Network
It is responsible for redirecting the connection and transferring the data between two different networks by physical means in search of the best path that allows this data to reach it destination in the shortest time possible. 

### Data Link
Addressing the physical transmission of the data, carrying out its encapsulation, and separating them into frames easily directed by the physical transfer media. 


### Physical
The user can manipulate it. The physical elements of the networks are responsible for the topology, and the global connections from the computer to the network allow the system's transmission and physical operation. 





# Network Devices. 

### Router
A router is a network device that forwards database to a logical address. In the case of TCP/IP networks, the router would forward data based on the IP addresses of the system. 


### Bridge
A network bridge device connects separate networks to make them into one larger network. This is different than a router
