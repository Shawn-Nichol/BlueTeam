# Risk
Risk is the possibility of a negative impact on practically anything. 
A vulnerability is a weakness that a threat can exploit. Vulnerabilities can be managed, whereas a threats cannot. 

Management of risk is done by applying controls to bring the risk to an acceptable level. Risk can be at different organizational levels, from a single piece of equipment to a whole department or division. 


# Risk Assessments
Risk assessments are conducted to identify and determine risk impacts, likelihood, and consequences should a risk materialize. This will help the organization make informed decisions based on the assessment outcome. 

**Conducting an Assessment**
- Identify potential hazards
- Identifying who might be harmed by those hazards
- Evaluating risk and establishing suitable precautions
- Implementing controls and recording your findings
- Review your assessment and re-assessing if necessary.

Risk assessments should be dynamic to be effective; they should be periodically reviewed and updated.

**Risk Reduction**
Risk can be reduced by applying mitigating controls, such as firewalls in front of an internet-facing website. 

**Risk Avoidance**
Risk can be completely removed by not engaging in a certain activity, such as not allowing employee-owned devices on corporate networks. 

**Risk Transfer**
Risk can be transferred to another party, such as purchasing cyber attack insurance. 

**Risk Acceptance**
If a risk in not high enough to warrant mitigating controls and would result in an acceptable impact, a business can accept the risk and take no action to address it. 

# Policies and Procedures
Policies is a plan of intent or course of action towards a particular domain. This could be a country's attitude towards an issue or a business plan of responsibilities. Some policies are laws or regulations, whereas some are principles, directions, or guidelines. They range in complexity, from home to office and government. Policies are at the highest level, followed by procedures and standards, and then guidelines. 

**Why are they used**
A policy outlines rules and provides principles that guide the actions to be taken, it will set out roles and responsibilities that can be accountable. 

**Standard Operating Procedures**
A standard operating procedure is a step-by-step set of instructions developed for a routine task. They provide specific technical processes and techniques used to complete a set task. This ensures tasks are performed effectively and efficiently while reducing errors, miscommunication, and failure to comply with regulations. If all members of a team or organization use the same SOP, this creates uniformity within the organization. An SOP can be written for almost any task and is periodically reviewed and developed. Any SOP should be tested prior to being put into practice. 

# Compliance and Frameworks. 
**Compliance** is defined as following rules and meeting requirements for specified frameworks. Organizations operating in different industries will have specific compliance frameworks to comply with. 

**GDPR**
is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the EU, it also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU. 

Controllers and processors of personal data must put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to implement the data protection principles. 


**ISO27001**
is an information security standard, part of the ISO 27000 family of standards, of which the latest version was published in 2013 with a few minor updates since. ISO27001 specifies a management system that is intended to bring information security under management control and gives specific requirements. Organizations that meet the requirements may be certified by an accredited certification body following the successful completion of an audit.
