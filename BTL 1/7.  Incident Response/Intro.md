# Security Events
A security event is anything that could have  asecurity implication such as causing damage or disruption
- SPAM emails
- Malicous actor perfroming a vulnerability scan
- Malicious actor perfroming areconnaissance scans
- Explained anomaly an unusual ciarcumstance, but the cause is identified and it is nto malicous
- User downloads software from the internet
- A malicious actor begins a brute force attack.

# Security Incidents
Security incidents are security events that have resulted in damage to the organization. 


# Events vs Incidents
Security events will typically be dealt with by securtiy analysts whereas security incidents are often handled by specialist incident responders who can perfrom advanced analsyiss and investigation into what exactly has occurred, and how to contain and respond to the incident. 


# Incident Response Lifecycle is split inot four different categories
The cycle is ongoing process and all four parts are used to help prevent the same  incident from recurring in the future. 

## Preperation
Being prepaded is one of the mos t important aspects of IR. Without the right teams, resources, or documentation then the incident response process is being set up for failure. With the right amount of preparation, you can prevent attacks before they even happen. 

Some activities that involve being prepared for incident are 
- Contact information for Stakeholders
- Having a war room forr central communication and coordination
- Documentation
- Baselines for running systems Equipment that can be used in an IR scenario

Activites that involve actively preventing incidents would be. 
Having current risk assessments
Utilizing Client and Server Security
Having a user awarness and training program established

## Detection and Analysis
The Detection & analysis phase of IR invloves two distinct sub-phases that if properly implemented, will be able to alert the CSIRT team at the company or organization of an active event taking place. 

Detection
Many organizations have tools such as IDS/IPS antivirus .. etc and log monitoring solution setup to alert the appropriate team when incidents are detected. 

Analysis 
Involves finding how the inital attack took place and how it moves throught the network. 

## Containment, Eradication, Recovery
Conatainment Stratgies
- Potenail damage to and theft of resources
- Need for evidence preservation
- Service availability
- Tiem and resources needed
- Effectiveness
- Duration of the solution.

Keep a detailed log of all evidence that you find regarding the attack. 

Eradication and recovery
This phase is the acto of returning the system back to normal. 

# Lessons Learned
- What happened and when did it happen
- How well did staff and management perfrom in dealing with the incident
- What information was needed sooner
- Were any steps or actiosn taken that might have inhibited the recovery
- What would staff and management do differently the next time a similar incident occurs.
- HOw could information sharing with other orgnaizations have improved
- What corrective actions can be taken
- What indicators should be watched for in the future
- What additional tools or resources are needed to mitigate future incidents.

- 


Reponders need to be able to 
- Effectively document their finding when analyzing the attack
- Prioritize actions that need to take place
- IR team needs to notify the proper authroities.
