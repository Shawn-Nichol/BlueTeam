# SIM (Security INformatino Management)
SIMS are mainly concerned with the collection and translation of infomration relating to the operation of a network. These elements collect data and logs from devices within an organization, and may even collect informatino from some devices or srouces outside the organization. 

Some action preformed by SIM
- Monitoring of events in real-time
- Sending and generating alerts and reports
- Automatic response to incidents
- Correlation of data from myultiple sources to improve the quality of the informatino prsented translation of events logs from different resources through XML.
- Translation of event logs from different resources through XML files.

Advantages
- Easy to deploy
-  They can store and analyze large volumes of data
-  They allow a fast and efficient analysis of all events in a system
-  They correlate logs and events to provide the most accurate overview of the system
-  They allow for easy threat management

Disavantages
- They can be very expensive
- It is not completely certain that they can be properly adapted to the working environment
- Some providers  do not provide full technial support for this type of service

# SEM (Security Event Managment)
SEM is a security software specialized in the identification, collection, moniotring, evaluation, notification and correlation in real-time of events and alerts of a computer system, whose purpose is to identify suspicious behavior within the system.

SEMs monitor and analyze events in real-time, searching for any kind of anomalous behavior that could mean an infection, incident or threat existing in the system. 
- Real-Time event monitoring
- Obtaining security events in devices and applications within the system
- Correlation of events to provide a clear picture of the information system
- Analyze logs according to their level of importance
- Real-time incident response

# SIEM
Is a combination of SIM and SEM that uses rules and statistical correlation to hel porganizatino detect threats and turn log entries, and events from security systems, into actinoable information. 

SIEM collects security data from network devices, servers, domain controllers, and more. It then stores, normalizes, aggregates and applies analytics to that data, which can help security teams detect threats, manage incident response and perfrom a forensic investigation.
