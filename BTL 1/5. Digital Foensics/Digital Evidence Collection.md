# ACPO Principles of Computer-based evidence
Association of Chief Police Officers

Principle 1
No action that is taken should change data held on a digital device that may be relied on as evidence.

Principle 2
Where a person finds it necessary to access original data held on a digital device, the person must be competent to do so and able to explain their actions and the implications of those actions on the digital evidence to a court. 

Principle 3
A trail or record of all actions taken that have been applied to the digital evidence should be created and preserved. An independent third-party forensic expert should be able to examine those processes and reach the same conclusion.

Principle 4
The individual who is leading the investigation has the overall responsibility to ensure that the ACPO principles are followed throughout the investigation.
