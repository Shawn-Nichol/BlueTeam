DFIR: Digital Forensics and Incident Response

DFIR process consits fo 5 steps, Identification, Preservation, Collection, Analysis, and Reporting. 


# Digital Forensics Process
1) Identification: The first stage of identifies poetnial sourcess of relvan t evidence or informatino, as well as key custodians and location data.
2) PReservation: The process of preserving relvant electroncially stored information (ESI).
3) Collection:Collecting digital information taht may be relevant to the investigation. collection may involve removing the electornic device from the crime or incident scene and then imaging, copying or printing out its content.
4) Analsysis: An in-depth systematic search of evidence relating to the incident being investigated. The outputs of the examination are data objects found in the collected information. These outputs may include system and user generated files.
5) Reporting: Reports are based on proven techniques and methodology and other competent forensic examiners should be able to duplicate and reproduce the same results.

A crucial activity that accompanies the first four steps is contemporaneous notetaking. This is the docuemntatin of what you have done immediately after you have cmopleted it and should provide sufficient detail for another person.to reproduce what you have done from the notes alone.
