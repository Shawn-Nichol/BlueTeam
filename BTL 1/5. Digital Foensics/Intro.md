DFIR: Digital Forensics and Incident Response

DFIR process consists of five steps: Identification, Preservation, Collection, Analysis, and Reporting. 


# Digital Forensics Process
1) Identification: The first stage identifies potential sources of relevant evidence or information, as well as key custodians and location data.
2) Preservation: Preserving relevant electronically stored information (ESI).
3) Collection: Collecting digital information that may be relevant to the investigation. Collection may involve removing the electronic device from the crime or incident scene and then imaging, copying, or printing out its content.
4) Analysis: An in-depth systematic search of evidence relating to the incident being investigated. The outputs of the examination are data objects found in the collected information. These outputs may include system and user-generated files.
5) Reporting: Reports are based on proven techniques and methodology, and other competent forensic examiners should be able to duplicate and reproduce the same results.

A crucial activity that accompanies the first four steps is contemporaneous note-taking. This is the documentation of what you have done immediately after you have completed it and should provide sufficient detail for another person. to reproduce what you have done from the notes alone.
