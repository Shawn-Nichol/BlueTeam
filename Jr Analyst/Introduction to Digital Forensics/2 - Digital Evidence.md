Most of the time, evidence will be files and other data on electornic storage media, such as hard drives in desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. We could be looking at an individaul who was found to have a folder of inappropriate iamges on his work laptop. This folder and all of its contents is evidence and needs to be prservereed so that it can be used for disciplainary actions within the company, or used for prosecution depending on the nature of the images. 

Other types of evidence found on standaalone computers  can include saved emails or saved chat logs, images, text files videos, audio files, and more. There are certain places on a computer wehre data can be hidden from immediate view, and this is a popular tactic fro crimals or individulas engaged in illegal activites. Files and data can be hidden in slack space on hard drives, and hidden inside legitimate files using steganoraphy. 

# Evidence Via Network
When moving away from physical storage and looking at networking, there are a number of evidence types we can collect and use. browser history isa bigone, by working as a record book of what sites the user has visited, we can use this to understnad what resources have been accessed online, and when. Thisis beneficial when dealing with events wehre an employee may be breachign the company's Acceptable Use Policy by inappropriately browsing the internet during work hours. 

We don't need to rely on the browser either - network devices such as web proxy or router will also hold information about requested sites online, as everything will likely go through these systems. 

In recent years, social media posts have been used as difital evidence in court, provided there is a resonnable belief that they were posted by the intended account owner. This can also extend to other sites where posts can be made, such as forums and blogs. Instant messaging conversations can also be used as evidence

How can digital forensics aanalysts ensure that the chain of custody is folowed. 

- It is imporatnt to have a record of who collected a pice of evidence and who has been responsible for it since it was collected. This measn if anything happens to it, the person assinged can be held accountable. Below is an exmaple of a form that would be found with phyiscal evidence, such as a laptop.

- If an Analyst is conductin a forensic investigation on a hard-dirve image, they should not be working on the oringal copy of the evidence. Theorignal disk image should be hashed and then a full-bit copy shold lbe taken, ensuring that abosolutely everything is included in the copied image. This new file should then hbe hashed, and if it is an exact copy, the file hashes will be the same. The analyst should then work on the copy, so the oringal evidence  is not modified, making it inadmissible in court.
