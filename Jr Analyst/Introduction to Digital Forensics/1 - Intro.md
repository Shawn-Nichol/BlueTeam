Digtial forensics, also known as computer forensics, is a specialized field within the realm of forrensic science that deals with the investigation, preservation,m analysis, and presentation of digital evidence. that will be used in an investigation. 

The primary goal is to establish the authenticity and integrity of the evidence, endabling it to be admissible in court, and ultimately, to assist in solving cyber crimes, intellectual property theft, fraud, and other digital-related offences. As technology evloves, digital forensics remains crucial in ensuring the integrity of digital evidence and upholding justice in the digital age. 

Digital Forensics from a Security OPerations perspective is often associated with monitoring of employees to maintain a high-security posture, aiding with incident response to reveal details of how a compromise occurred and any pot-actions. 

# Types of digital forensics
These are the 4 main types of digital forensics used in cybersecurity. 

- Computer FOensic: Identifying, collecting, and prsevering evidence taken from desktops, laptops and other computer systems and storage media to aid investigations oor legal proceedings.
- Network Forensics: The monitoring, collection, and analysis of network activities such as visited websites and connected IPs, usually associated with incident response and intrustion detection.
- Memory Forensics: The Process of recovering evidence from the RAM of a running system
- Mobile FOrensics: The process of recovering evidence from mobile phones, SIM cards, PDSAs, tablets and other mobile devices.

# Benifits of DIgital Forensics
Supportin Incident Response Capabilities
Having a better incident response capability can be achieved by having additional team members with storng technical backgrounds and skills that can help when respondign to escalated security events. When dealing with an incident, it iis important to correctly gather and prserve evidence so it can be  used for analysis, intelligence sharing, and potential procsecution. Digital Forensics analysts can be a great assest when it comes to analysing malcious activites, from a malware infection to an insider threat, using hteir deep technical knowlege, analysis techniques and monitoring capabilties. 


Legal Prosecution
Chain of Custody, this a procedure to follow for digital evidence to be submitted in court. If this evidence is not kept secure, accounted for, and unmodified at all times, it will not be valid and hold no wieght in court. Foensics experts will be familar with how to collect and handle evidence appropriately, keeping it secure. 

Monitoring Employees
Sometimes employees need to be mnoitored closely due to suspicious or malicious behavior. This could include inappropriate internet browsing on work systems, breaches of an Acceptable Use Policy, downloading malicious or inappropriate files, or any other scenario that requires intervention from the security team. Foensics analysts will likely be trained to monitor for insider threats, and covertly collect evidence which can be used by the Human rResources  department as justification for firing an amployee, or handing over to law enforement if the users activity breaks any laws. 


# Associaiated Roles

### Tier 1 SOC Analyst
T1 Analysts will generally conduct inital investigations, mainly first-line incident response, and collect evidence that will be added to an investigation case. THis evidence is then used as justification for taking defensiive measures, such as blocking an IP, domain, or email sender. Here an analyst will need to understand that these artefacts IPS, emails, domains are considered evidence for the investigation.

### Tier 2/3 SOC Analyst
T2/T3 Analysts willl typically handle escalted/more critical investigations that requrire more technical expertise, or access to additional tools osr sensors. Due to the nature of crictical and higher-priority investigations, the related evidence is likley to be collected and handled uner more strict conditions. 

### Malware Analyst
Within the security operations domain, Digital Forensics can also be sused as a trerm to refer to the process of malware analysis. Taking a sample of malware and using differnt techniques to discover what is prupose is, and how to dtect int in the  future by agathering IOCs. 

### Digital Forensics Analyst
Digital Forensics Analysts will work on high-profile investigations, escalted cases, employyee monitoring, working with the security INcident Response Team, and other tasks that require trustedd and highly-tehcnical individuals. 

### Insider threat Analyst
Securioty professionals that focus on detecting and monitoring insider threats will utlize their extensive digirtal forensics siklls to ensure that no stone is left unturned and that any and all evidence against an indivual is collected in the appropriate manner. 

### Threat Hunter
Threat Hunters are experts tehcnical defenders that have a deep understanding of both offesive and dfensive practices. TO be able to effectively hunt these indivduals need to truly understand how computers and networs work and also understand key arefacts that can be found and used as evidence on an intrusion

### Incident Responder
Incident responders are top-tier security analyst who typically poses skills across a dwide reange of blue-team disciplines, foensics being one of them. This allows them to conduct deeper more in-depth investigation sin order to udnerstand how the systme was compromised and the hebaior of the device. 

An Incidnet Responder sometimes works closely with FOrensics Examiners, escpeically on tasks such as retrieving dta from physical media such as laptops and phones and using specialis tools to process and alyase the data to find indicators of malicious activity. 


# Evidence Collection
### KAPE
Kape (Kroll Artifact Parser adn Extractor) is a free and open-0-source digital forensics tool devleoped. Designe dto automate the collection and parsing of foresnic atefacts from a computers file system and memory. Kape can be deployed locally or on remote systems to quickly gather key data. This allows analyst to begin investigating while the length process of taking a disk image is being conducted. KAPE can retrieve aretfacts relating to browaser usage, program execution, the fiesystem logs and much more. 

### FTK Imager
FTK Image is a massive tool that allows us to create hard dirve images, but also memory imagews, which can be analyzed in other progams. It's also possible to import disk images into FTK, allowing us to navigate through the file system as if we were on a lie device

### Encase
Just like FTK, EnCase is a suite of tools that has a wide range of functinoality for digital forensics and e-Desicvoery. EnCase can be aused to take forensic images of cmoputers, mobile phones, and IoT devices, which can then be analyzed to colalect digital evidence. 

### Cellebrite
Cellebrite is a suite of tools designed primarily for mobile forensics, which allows easy acquisition of data from a mobile device so it can be processed in the tools covered in the section. 

#Evidence Analysis

### Autopsy
Autopsy is an open-source digital foensics tool that helps investigators analyze and extract evidence from various data sources, such as hard drives and mobile devices. It works by creating a forensic image of the target storage media and then running in-depth searches to quickly retrieve key information, such as recently used programs, deleted files emails, visited websites, and much more. 

### Volatitliy
Volatilti is a python-based memory forensics framework that enables the analysis of emory dumps or memory images. It captures a snapshot of a computer's memory, allowing users to serach for valuable information. This dataaids in undersntanding the cmoputer's past activites and uncovering potential evidence of malicous actions
Volatitliy is a python-based memory forensics framework that enables the anlysis of emmory dumps or emmory images. It captures a snapshot of computers emmory, allowing users, to serach for valuable information. THis data aids in understanding the computers past activites and uncovering poptenial evidence of malicious actions. 

Volatiltiy's versatility extends to analyzing memory from various operating systems, inacluding Windows, Linux and Mac OS, making it suitable for a wide range of scenarios, Moreover, it can recover delted fiels that might be inaccessible through other means, enchancing its utlity.
