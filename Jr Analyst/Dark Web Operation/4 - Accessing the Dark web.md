TOR was founded by individual researchers who worked at the US Naval Research Laboratory. David Goldshlag, Mike Reed, and Paul Syverson realized there was a distinct lack of internet security in the 1990s and saw how easy it was to perform surveillance, so they decided to find a solution that would work to protect the privacy of internet users. Their solution was onion routing. 

The basic explanation for how onion routing works is that instead of traffic going from A > B, it goes from A > C > J > K > B, and the traffic is encrypted at each part of the journey, making sure that it can't be intercepted or sniffed during transit. This also meant that it was extremely difficult for B to identify where the request had come from. 

For TOR to function, it needed a decentralized network - a larger number of independently owned servers known as nodes That worked together to form a network, which would later be named the Tor network. To make it accessible for new nodes to be created, in October 2002, the code for Tor was released as free and open-source software, and within a year, there were 13 active Tor nodes. 

The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to defending civil liberties in the digital world, saw the importance of the Tor network in 2004 and began funding the work being completed by Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson. In 2006, they formed the Tor Project, a non-profit organization, so they could receive funding in order to continue developing and maintaining Tor.
