# What can be achieved Legally

# Legal Activities

Organizations are able to passively collect threat intelligence from dark web sources. This means scraping publicly accessible sources is permitted. Organizations can silently watch and listen to activity on the dark web and record it for other purposes, such as dissemination or for selling to clients. 

Access private dark web forums legally. This goes hand-in-hand with the above point - provided individuals can gain legitimate access to a forum, they are permitted to scrape the contents for later analysis or sharing. Legal access in this context means that the individuals need to be invited into the forum or by purchasing access. 

Masquerade as a criminal on forums, asking for advice from criminals or hackers in order to collect intelligence. This must be well documented so that law enforcement knows this is for legitimate purposes and not genuine criminal activity. 

# Illegal Activities
Providing dark web forums or private site staff with illegal material in order to gain access or build trust, such as malware or personal information that could be used to conduct crimes. 

Accessing forums or private sites by brute-forcing account credentials, exploiting a vulnerability, using compromised credentials belonging to another user, or impersonating a real person. 

Assist individuals or parties in committing crimes by offering advice, information, money, or resources, as this makes you an accessory to any crimes that occur as a result. 


# Intel Gathering By Law Enforcement
Security benefits
- Information about cyber attacks that are being planned or launched in the near future - allows security teams to prepare.
- Information about malicious actors selling access to companies - this can allow security teams to identify the compromised accounts or systems and kick the attacker out.
- information about malicious actors selling malware and hacking tools - this can provide valuable indicators that a security team can proactively block
- Data breach dumps typically end up on the dark web, either freely available or sold at an auction -  being able to access the list of breached credentials can help organizations to identify if any of their corporate accounts were included, so they can reset the passwords and ensure no malicious actors can gain access.
