# Clear Web
This part of the internet has many names, such as the Clear web, Surface web, and Indexed Web. These are the sites that you access daily, such as Facebook, Google, YouTube, Reddit, and so on. These websites and web pages are indexed on a mass scale by search engines such as Google and Bing, which is why we can find them when using search engines. 

Crawlers are a type of software that searches the internet for publicly available web pages so that search engines can offer them as results. These bots go from site to site, link to link, finding every page that they're allowed to view and reporting back. 

The Clear Web consists of legal sites that are generally designed for use by the public and tend not to have obscure methods of gaining access, such as a special key or IP whitelisting.

# Deep web
The Deep web, also known as the underground web or invisible web, is the part of the internet that isn't indexed by conventional search engines, such as Google or Bing. Either the site owners have prevented crawlers from indexing their site, or they have implemented access controls to only allow their intended audience to access the site. The Deep web is huge. Public information on the deep Web is currently 400 to 550 times larger than the commonly defined WWW. 

Dark and Deep web are not the same thing. Log on to your Amazon account; you're on the deep web. These are web pages that are not indexed or publicly available; imagine if anyone could search on Google and find your private Amazon page with your order history, payment details, and more private information. Not everything on the Deep web is illegal or shady; it's just private pages that only certain people should have access to. Other examples include private forums, private membership pages, and online banking. 

# Dark Web
A section of the internet that is utilized for anonymity, illegal operations, intelligence gathering, and more. Whilst some search engines do exist for the Dark Web, sites are usually hidden, and you'll need to know the exact URL in order to find them. Sites on the Dark Web use the Top Level Domain (TLD). onion as opposed to clear web TLDs such as .com or .co.uk

Regardless of your geographical location, it is not illegal to visit the Dark Web(don't hold us to that). Whilst accessing the Dark Web isn't illegal, there is a large amount of illegal content, and viewing this or interacting with it could substitute for an illegal offense. 

# Why is the Dark Web Useful
### Threat Intelligence Collection
A large amount of useful intelligence can be gathered from the dark web, such as malware and vulnerabilities for sale, uncovering the planning of cyberattacks on private forums, tracking threat actors online, and much more. We will cover this in a future lesson. 

### Law Enforcement Operations
Using the dark web, law enforcement officers can infiltrate private sites, forums, and marketplaces in order to collect evidence that would be used in the case of legal prosecution against individuals involved in illegal activity. By joining the criminals in cyberspace, police officers and other law enforcement units are able to take the fight straight to the bad guys and work to shut down sites, collect intelligence, and disrupt criminal operations. 

### Freedom of Speech
In some countries, the government works to closely monitor all communications and remove any that they do not agree with, an act called censorship. Using TOR, individuals from these countries can bypass internet restrictions such as website blocking or get messages out to the wider world, letting them know what's happening in their location. 

### Privacy 
Whilst TOR does not provide 100% anonymity, it does provide more security in terms of privacy than using a normal browser such as Chrome. Due to the way TOR operates, your IP will be masked by a number of nodes, working like a VPN to hide your true address. 


# Associated Roles
### Threat Analyst
Threat Analysts are responsible for ensuring that information about their company is as limited as possible on sources such as the Dark Web. This includes searching for discussions about future attacks, employee credentials in data breach dumps, and more. Whilst there are tools out there that scrape the Dark Web for intelligence, Threat Analysts may attempt to infiltrate forums or private websites themselves, depending on their exact job description. 

### Malware Analyst
Malware Analysts may attempt to retrieve malware samples from sources such as the Dark Web, in order to conduct analysis and gather IOCs that can be used to help defend their organization by creating alerts or rules in different security systems such as SIEM, EDR, and IDPS. Dark Web marketplaces typically sell commodity malware (RATs and Trojans and key loggers) as well as more advanced malware for the right price - knowing how to effectively defend against these is important, as it reduces the risk to the organization. 

### Security Researcher
Security Researchers are individuals who work to detect and report on security-related activity, and the Dark Web is an attractive scene for them due to the illegal activity that takes place, including the sale of malware, selling access to compromised hosts, zero-day vulnerability sales, and much more. Researchers may choose to infiltrate underground forums and private sites in order to collect intelligence and share it with the world. 


### Law Enforcement
Law Enforcement agencies will work to detect illegal activities, gather evidence, and eventually take action. Examples of these Dark Web operations include the shutting down of Silk Road, which was previously the largest underground marketplace known for its huge drug trade. In October 2013, the FBI shut down Silk Road and arrested the individual behind the site, who was sentenced to life in prison. Silk Road 2.0 was set up and again taken down by the FBI, who arrested the new owner as part of Operation Onymous, which targets Darknet marketplaces. 

The UK's National Crime Agency has been recruiting intelligence officers for their Dark Web Intelligence Collection and Exploitation unit.
