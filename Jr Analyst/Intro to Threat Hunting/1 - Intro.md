# Threat Hunting explained
Organizations across the world face threats every day! Instead of peacefully sitting in the SOC waiting for alerts to funnel through a ticketing system, professionals need to actively detect and isolate these advanced attacks before grave damages can occur. This is called Threat Hunting. 

Threat hunting is an aggressive approach that is built to unhide threats that are hidden in a network or system, evading more standard security tools. Standards  tools like firewalls, IDS, and SIEMS all rely on alerts to stimulate actions. Alerts are not perfect, and they can lead analysts into embarking on a time-consuming and resource-draining chase. These false positives can make any SAOC analyst susceptible to alert fatigue, which can lead to stress and burnout. 

By contrast, threat hunters utilize an approach that is less reliant on detection technology. They focus more on an attacker's technique rather than the volatile indicators. This aggressive approach pushes away from the traditional dependence on rules or signatures to trigger alerts. Threat hunters also experience far less mental fatigue than SOC analysts. 

Summary
Threat hunting is a research-focused and innovative detection approach entirely different form the traditional SOC Analyst-  which happens to be more technology-focused. The practice mindset of tagging interesting techniques and formulating hypotheses for the new attack techniques is imperative for organizations in the 21 century.
