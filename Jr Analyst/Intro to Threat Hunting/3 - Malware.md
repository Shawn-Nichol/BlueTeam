# Overview of Malware. 
What is Malware? The name is derived from malicious software, which is any program that has been created for malicious purposes, such as encrypting files or stealing passwords.

There are a number of types of malware, from spyware to Ransomware, Trojans to Worms. Whilst they can vary dramatically in their sophistication and ability to evade security defenses, they are all ultimately bad in some way and have a negative impact on the systems that become infected. 

When talking about threat hunting, we are searching advanced threats that have managed to enter the network, and then operate covertly so that they are not discovered. It is our job to uncover them using technical methods. 

# How to hunt malware
Covert malware found using IOCs shared with the hunter.

Comparing known-good values against systems to check for any differences. Ex. comparing properties of Windows processes to see if they haveen altered. 
Ex. we could create an IOC file that has the file hashes of important processes such as winlogon.exe, smss.exe, and others. Obviously, this would alert these files to us because they should match - so we would set the IOC value to IS NOT. If any files with important names do not match  their official hash, we know that they have been modified or replaced, and this is something we would look into more.
