OSINT, short for Open-Source Intelligence, is data that has been obtained from publicly available sources. OSINT is widely used within law enforcement work, cybercrime activities such as planning an attack, or for business operation purposes, such as checking out the competition. 

A company that has a public web page that introduces some/all of their employees. An attacker could use this to very easily gather a list of targets for social engineering attacks. Some sites may even include contact email addresses or phone numbers, which can aid the social engineering process dramatically. 

Job Descriptions that leak information about a company's internal systems. Ex a system administrator role requiring experience with Server 2016 and Solaris. An attacker can use this to plan internal attacks, lateral movement, and privilege escalation once they have gained a foothold in the network. 

Photos on social media that are geotagged and contain device information in the metadata.

Reading a user's social media profile to build up a profile of them. This can be used to learn more about an individual, which is commonly done pre-interview so that employees can get a sense of how the person will act in the workplace. 

Exposing Cyber Criminals. Whilst this begins to move into the Threat Intelligence domain, it is possible to use OSINT sources and social engineering skills to identify the true identity of cybercriminals and pass the details to law enforcement. 

# Why is it useful 
## Defenders
By looking at the information that is available on the internet, defenders can take steps to reduce this or implement other controls that will mitigate attacks or reduce their effectiveness. If an attacker was able to build a detailed profile on an employee, this could be very dangerous. However, if that employee has had security training, then they will potentially be better at spotting malicious emails and social engineering attacks. By removing information online that may aid an attacker, the defenders are reducing the attack surface, which is the total area that an attacker could exploit to gain access to internal systems. This activity is often referred to as conducting public exposure assessments. Ex. include gathering information employees put on social media identifying internet-facing assets. DNS checks, finding old login portals or websites. 

## For Law Enforcement
Government and Police organizations will utilize OSINT to track persons of interest, such as criminals, suspects, and terrorists. Profiling is the activity of collecting information on an individual to build up a picture of their personality and behavior. This can be used to predict where they will be at certain times based on interests and previous locations. OSINT can be used to uncover the identities of cybercriminals that have poor OPSEC (operational Security -  the Practice of hiding yourself online by disassociating your online persona from your real self). It can also be used to help find missing persons.


## For Businesses
Businesses can utilize OSINT to keep an eye on the competition, watch for market activity, learn more about their customer and how to best engage with them, improve business operations via data enrichment, and also monitor for security risks such as leaked credentials, employees sharing confidential information, or hackers planning attacks.

A big part of this is monitoring the social media channels of competitors to see what they're doing well, as this can be used to bolster the company's social media and marketing strategies. 

## For Attackers
OSINT sources are a great way to discover information about a target company or individual. By working out what systems a company uses, the right exploits and attack methods can be planned out in advance. Employee information can be harvested, allowing potentially effective social-engineering attacks and spear-phishing email campaigns to be conducted, tailored to their intended targets to make them more believable. A company should be careful about the information its systems and employees are sharing online. The process of collecting this information for malicious purposes is commonly referred to as target information gathering or passive information gathering. 


# Associate Roles
Tactical Threat Analysts may use OSINT to conduct intelligence operations, gathering information on adversaries that may target their organization. By performing malicious actor tracking, they can stay up to date with the latest trends and techniques used by these groups in order to implement defenses. They can also collect IOCs from OSINT sources and use these to conduct threat exposure checks internally. 

Strategic Threat Analysts may conduct threat exposure assessments, working to identify any information that the organization is leaking out on the internet. This can be information regarding internal systems and employees who are posting photos of their ID cards on social media. 

Security analysts will use OSINT data for a number of reasons, such as checking the reputation of IOCs such as IP address or email address and file hashes. Other use cases could include investigating fake social media accounts that are being used to launch social engineering attacks against employees. 

Vulnerability Analyst, OSINT is a crucial part of this role. Keeping up to date with the latest publicly-announced vulnerabilities, following vulnerability researchers on social media, and information sharing is a really important part of the work these guys do. A great OSINT source is the National Vulnerability Database, using TweekDeck to monitor Twitter for vulnerability-related news and disclosures. 

Penetration Tester/Red Teamer, Offensive security specialists will use OSINT to gain information about their target company, such as internal systems and employee information. This will be used to tailor attacks, helping to reduce the noise they make, and to make them more likely to succeed, resulting in a faster penetration assessment.
