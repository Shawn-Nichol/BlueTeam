OSINT, short for Open-Source Intelligence, is data that has been obtained from publicly available sources. OSINT is widely used within law enforecment work, cybercrime activities such as planning an attack, or for business operation purposes, such as checking out the competition. 

A company that has a public web page that introduces some/all of their employees. An attacker could use this to very easily gather a list of targets for social engineering attacks. Some sites may even incluade contact email addresses or phone numbers, which can aid the social engineering process dramatially. 

Job Descriptions that leak information about a company's internal systems. Ex a system administrator role requiring expericnce with Server 2016 and Solaris. An attack can use this to plan internal attacks, lateral movement, and privilege escalation once they have gained a foothold in the network. 

Photos on social media that are geotagged and contain device infromation in the metadata.

Reading a user's socail media profile to build up a profile of them. This can be used to learn more about an individual, which is commonly done pre-interview so that employees can get a sensse of how the person will act in the workplace. 

Exposing Cyber Criminals. Whilst this begins to move into the Threat Intelligence domain, it is possible to use OSINT sources and soical-engineering skills to identify the true identiy of cybercriminals and pass the details to law enforcement. 

# Why is it useful 
## Defenders
By looking at the infromation taht is available on the internet, defenders can take steps to reduce this, or implement other controls that will mitigate attacks or reduce their effectiveness. If an attacker was able to build a detailed profile on an employee, this could be very dangerous. However, if that employee has had securtiy training, then they will potentially be better at spotting malicious emails and social engineering attacks. By removing information aonline that may aid an attacker, the defenders are redcuing the attack surface, which is the total area that an attacker could exploit to gain access to internal systems. This activity is often areferred to as conducing public exposure assessments. Ex. include gather information employees put on social media, identifying internet-facing assets. DNS checks, finding old login portals or websites.
