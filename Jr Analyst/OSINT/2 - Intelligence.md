It doesn't matter if you are a member of a law enforcement agency or a security analyst for a company, either way when you are in an intelligence scenario you will likely be facing the same landscape. On one hand, you will have a huge amount of data that must be analyzed, and on the other, you will have a probelm that must be solved. 

When dealing with this scenario you need to take advantage of the massive amount of data at your disposal and use it to create an intelligence report that provides a clear explanation of the solutions you are llooking for. 

The only issue here is that intelligence reports do not grow on trees. So you must not only identify all this data but also classify and organize it in such a way that all this data can be converted into information.

For these situations, there has always been a process of knowledge creation called the Intelligence Cycle. This iterative model describes a series of stages and procedures that a researcher has to perfrom to convert the collected data and information into tintlligence products capable of brining solutions to the organization. 

This process is carried out in 5 steps. 
1) Planning and direction
This first stage is the crucial element of the research process, it si the moment when you define which horizon willl your investigation take. This is where you deetermine the prupose of your research and what kind of information you are looking for.

2) Collection

In this second phase your objective willl be the identification of which kind of processes you will use to carry out the collection of such information, and thenn, using all the techniques youo know, obtain the data that will help you carry out your intelligence operation.

3) Processing

You will take care of all that was obtained in the previou sprocess.

Here your objective is not only the visualization of the informmation but also the application of decoding, decryption, validation, and evaluation techniques that will allow you to filter the hugeg amount of information you obtained, to identify useful data for your rsearch. 

4) Analysis

Here you must compile all the infromation yoou filtered in teh previous step to obtain the solutions to your initial problem, as well as the creation of a coherent intelligence product that allows you to clearly explain the process you recently carried out. 

5) Dissemnation

Deliver the product you developed throught the process to the stakeholders that request it. This will help these people make infomrred and appropriate decisions when tackling the oringal problem.
