Instructions

1.	Please refer to the Course Challenge Brief for instructions on what you are being asked to do.
2.	Answer all questions mentioned below.


Overview

>> Provide an overview of the results from the scan. How vulnerable is this system?<<

Top 5 Most Serious Security Issues (In priority order - most important first):

>> What are the 5 most critical issues with the scanned system? Talk about each one, and what could happen if an attacker exploits the vulnerability <<

1.	NFS Exported share information Disclosure
2.	UnrealRCd Backdoor Detection, a version of unreallRDd with a backdoor that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected host.
3.	VNC Server password Password, secured with a weak password
4.	SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection, SSL 2 has weak cryptography, and SSL 3 is not considered out of date by NIST. 
5.	Bind Shell backdoor Detection, a shell listening to a remote port that doesn’t require authentication.

Top 5 - Remediations (In priority order - most important first):
>> What are the suggested remediation actions to address the top 5 most critical security flaws? Re-word them, don’t just copy and paste Nessus’ suggestions <<

1.	Configure NFS on the remote host so that only authorized hosts can mount their remote shares
2.	Re-download the software, verify it using the published MD5/SHA1 checksums, and re-install it. 
3.	Secure the VNC service with a strong password
4.	Disable SSL 2 and 3. Use TLS 1.2 or higher. 
5.	Verify if the remote host has been compromised and reinstall the system if necessary.
