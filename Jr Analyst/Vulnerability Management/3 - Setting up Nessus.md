# Nessus Menu

## My Scans
Any scans that the currently signed-in user has conducted. This includes completed, scheduled, pending, and failed scans. 

## All Scans
Any scans that have been conducted by any users within an organization. This includes completed, scheduled, pending, and failed scans. 

## Trash
Once you've got a scan template, you can send it to the Trash so it is no longer in the My Scans or All Scans tab.

## Policies
Scans are conducted by using a target and a policy, which is a list of settings and plugins that you use. Different plugins will identify and test different things. 

## Plugin Rules 
Plugins are the part of Nessus that conducts the scanning and enumeration. Using different ones will provide different results, so this is where you can fine-tune the scan to look for specific security issues. 

## Scanners 
Scanners are different hosts that can perform enumeration. This is useful if there are multiple V-LANs or physical networks that need to be scanned and the hosts can't communicate directly. In our case, we only have one local scanner running in our VM
