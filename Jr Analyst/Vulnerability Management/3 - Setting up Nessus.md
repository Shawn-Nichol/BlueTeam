## All Scans
Any scans that have been conducted by any users within an organisation. This includes completed, scheduled, pending and failed scans. 

## Trash
Once you've got a scan template you can send it ot the Trash, so that it is no longer in the My Scans or all scans tab

## Policies
Scans are conducted by using a target and a policy, which is a list of settings and plugins that you use. Different plugins will identify and test different things. 

## Plugin Rules 
Plugins are the part of Nessus that actually conduct the scanning and enumeration. using different ones will provide different results, so this iw where you can fine tune the scan to look for specific security issues. 

## Scanners 
Scanners are different hosts that are able to perfrom enumberation. This is useful if there are multiple V-LANs or physical networks that need to be scanned and the hosts can't communicate directly. In our case, we only have one the local scanner running in our VM
