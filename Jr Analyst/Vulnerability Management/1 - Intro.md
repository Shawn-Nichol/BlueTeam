# What is Vulnerablity Management
Is the process of identifying security falws and vulnerabilities in software, reporting on these so they can be fixeed, with agoal of reducing the risk and impact of cyber-attacks. 

- Identification: Using vulnerability scanners, manual techniques, and assets dsicovery methods to identify and record systems, along wtih any security issues they have with scores based on different factores.
- Reporting: Reporting these issues to appropriate stakeholders so they can be addressed, and eventually resolved.
- Remediation: Having the security issues fixed by the system owner or technical owner so that they security flaw is no longer present. Different methods can be used to remediate vulnerabilites, such as security patches reconfigurations, or mitigation controls
- Reassessment: Scanning or manually achecking to ensure the security issues have been successfully fixed

This is a cyclic process, so assets should routinely be scanned, especially after major chagnes. Identifying and fixing vulnerabilites quickly means mmalicous actors have less time to discover and exploit them.

# Why is it useful
Vulnerabilites are announced contantly, and most of them affect software that is used on a mass scale. 50 new vulnerabilities were detected everyday on average in 2017. 

Beign able to keep on top of these issues, and make sure products are patched as soon as possible means that hackers have less time to attempt exploitation. 

By ensuring internet-facing systems are secure, it's harder for attackers to get in, and by ensuring internal systems are secure, it's harder for attacker to move around, and complete the actions they want to, such as privilege escalation or information harvesting. 

# Associated Roles
The bleow roles generally contain work that includes aspects of vlunerability managment, such as vulnerability scanning, knolege of exploitation, and system hardening

### Threat intelligence Analyst
Receivign and reporting on intelligence about newly release vulnerabilities, or vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited in the wild, and by which threat actors. Intelligence Analysts will usually have access to commercial tools that allow them to observer exploitation activity on a global scale, as well as undergound discussions about vbulnerabilitites, helping the vulnerability analysts to prioritize which issues need to be fixed first. 

### Vulnerability Analyst
Identifying, reporting on, and helping to remediate vulnerable assets to harden the state and reduce risk from cyber attacks. Daily tasks include vulnerability scanning, analyszing results, perfroming manual checks, reporting on security flaws, and keeping up-to-date with the latest pubilcly available news regarding vulnerabilitites, as well as receiving threat intelligence reports from intelligence Analysts. 

### Incident Responder
Knowledge about vulnerabilities, and how to deal with compromises as a result of successful exploitation is key in the knowning how to respond in teh most effective way. 

### Penetration Tester / Red Teamer
Knowign how to tidentify and scan for vulnerabilities and s wsecurity flaws is key to this role, allowing you to exploit systems and gain access for security pruposes, reporting on these so that Vulnerability Analysts can work with stakeholders to get the system remediated. 

# A day in the life
I was previously responsible for ensuring that thousands of endpoints around the world, including servers, websites, aworkstations, networking equipment, IoT, and mobile devices allstay secure. Sounds like fun, right? Hmmm... yeah. 

I'm kdding - I loved it. In this role, you get a perfect mix of Red and Blue team. you get to hack stuff, but they get it fixed so some nasty threat actor can't do the same thing. 

fOver the past year we've had some pretty nasty vunerabilities. Arguably the most important has been CVE-2019-0708, a Zzero-day vulnerability in WIndows RDP. This remote code execution vulnerability could allow a hacker to bypass any authentication over RDP and connect dierectly to a system over the internet without valid credentials. This was BIG. I read some of the first public announcements on Twitter, and imddediately set up some Tweetdeck columns to monitor for keywords such as CVE-2-019-0708, RDP, zeroday, and Bluekeep. I turned to the other analysts in teh Vulnerability Managmement team and said, guys, take a look at this, and sent them the details. At this poitn we genuinely laughted, becuase we knew this would be huge and we'd update and inform the SOC manager and SecOps Director. next we drafte up an email notifcation taht is going to essentially every department we have, informing them to apply the MS issued sedcurity patches for everything mentioned that if anything didn't ned RDP open, disable the service ASAP. We go out global DMZa patched the same day, and people gegan queueing patches for internal assets. Over the next few days we ran vulnerabiltliy scnas against our internet-facing systems to sese if RDP was still present anywhere. Other OSINT sources like Shodan helped us check for exposure. Throught the week we also had threat intelligence anlyst looking to see if any Public Exploit code or exploits were detected in the wild. I also wshared any intelligence I discovered myself via a government-owned inforamtion sharing platform. 

Although events like this aren't common, there's always work to do. Researching publicly announced vulnerabilities, checking them against the estate, getting systems patched, vulnerability scanning, manually checking and exploiting vulnerabilites, threat sinmulation attacks, analysing reports gerneated by OSINt sources such as SHodan and ShadowServer, communicating with teams in other organizations, helping investigate SIEM alerts regarding vulenrability/system exploitintation, web-app pentesting our sites, and much more. 

# Getting a Job
To start it's worth mention that this all my own opinion, and is not a definitive guide to landing a job as a Vulnerability Analyst. SBTY or mysdelf are notendorsed by an  companies/websites/services metnioned in this page, they'rejsut good ast what they do. Take this as some friednly advice, based on my experincies and the thought of my fellow analysts.

If you think a Vulnerability analyst role sounds interesting and you want to try to land a job in this position, then blelow is some advie including skills to focus on experincices to gain, andd other ways you can potentiall y improve your chances. 

### Soft Skills
- Commonuication: this one is super important. You're going to be communciation with a lot of people in this role, including yoiyuour won team, the wider security team, stakeholders frome essentially every department, managment and even other oranizations. You shoul have a high level of written and verbla communciation, and be able to pass tehcnial information to non-technical audiences in a a way that they can understand.
- Analytical: You should be analytical, which means you're good at problem solving as well as collecting and analyzing information. An example of this when you receive the output from a vulnerability scanner, you should be able to interpret the results and udnerstand what the report is telling you, so you can work to prioritize remediation.
- Teamwork: This a pretty obivos one, but as metnioned abovve you're potentially oging to be working with a lot of people, and you need to be able tow work effectively toegether, in some cases in very pressured and fast-paced situations.
- Time Management: if you're going to be responsible for conducitn vulernability scans, you need to be very skilled  in time management. Not only do you need to find the best time to scan but you'll also need to make sure you keep everyone updated with vulnerabilities that are being exploited in the wild, co-ordinating rmediation activites and otehr tasks that require time to be planned effieiently.

### Security Related KNowledge
If you haven't already worked in a security position, there are some things you can do to really goost your knowledge, skills, and look better in a hiring managers eyes. 

- Getting hand-on with vulnerability scanners such as Nessus, OpenVas and Nikto. THis shows that you understand how these tools work, who to conduct vulenrabilty scans and what etherir outputs look like. you can get experince like this by downlaoding the Metaspoitable 2 intertionally vulnerabile vitural mahcine downlaoding other vulerabil vireatl machiens from VulnHub, or scanning machiens on pentetration etesting platforms such as Hack the Box.

- Show that you keep up-to-date with the latest security enws, expecially surounding vulenrabilites. You can do this by using platforms such as TweetDeck to monitor for terms sucha as Vulenerability, CVE and other prases that will show tweets regarding vulnerabilities and exploitation.

- Having a blog with hacking write-ups ora Github with custom tools. These will both go a long way when trying to get your first job in security or even move up the ladder. By running a blog it shows that youare really motivated and driven, somethign that is very atttractive in employess. Writing up how you hacked or owned machines on HackTheBox is a great activity, and shows that you understand how to identify and exploit vulenrabilites. With up tasks. Create your own 



# CVE and CVSS scores
CVEs and CVSS scores are two things you'll hear a lot about when dealing with vulneabilites. Thy help us to share information regarding security issues, and rate them using a scal from Low to Critical using numerical values based on a large number of factores. This lesson will quicly cover what they are, and why tehy're really important to us. 

### Common Vulnerabilites and Exposures
CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a way to standardize names for publicly-known vulnerabilities. I like to think of CXVEs workign like domain ames. Everyone knows google.com but most people don't know the website IP. We use Googlecom becuase its convenient, easy to remeaber, and easy to use. The same agoes for CVEs. I know that CVE-2019-0708 is assinged to RDP zero-day remote code execution vulnerability name BlueKeep. It makes life easier when talking about vulenrabiliteis, or sharing infomration bewteen different vulnerability databases, tools and services .TH term CVE, which is copyrighted by MITRE, is stated taht CVE Entries are comprised of an identifcation number, a description and at least one public reference.
