# What is Vulnerability Management
It is the process of identifying security flaws and vulnerabilities in software and reporting on these so they can be fixed, with the goal of reducing the risk and impact of cyber-attacks. 

- Identification: Using vulnerability scanners, manual techniques, and asset discovery methods to identify and record systems, along with any security issues they have, with scores based on different factors.
- Reporting: Reporting these issues to appropriate stakeholders so they can be addressed and eventually resolved.
- Remediation: Having the security issues fixed by the system owner or technical owner so that the security flaw is no longer present. Different methods can be used to remediate vulnerabilities, such as security patches, reconfigurations, or mitigation controls.
- Reassessment: Scanning or manually checking to ensure the security issues have been successfully fixed

This is a cyclic process, so assets should be routinely scanned, especially after major changes. Identifying and fixing vulnerabilities quickly means malicious actors have less time to discover and exploit them.

# Why is it useful
Vulnerabilities are announced constantly, and most of them affect software used on a mass scale. Fifty new vulnerabilities were detected every day on average in 2017. 

Being able to keep on top of these issues and make sure products are patched as soon as possible means that hackers have less time to attempt exploitation. 

By ensuring internet-facing systems are secure, it's harder for attackers to get in, and by ensuring internal systems are secure, it's harder for attackers to move around and complete the actions they want to, such as privilege escalation or information harvesting. 

# Associated Roles
The below roles generally contain work that includes aspects of vulnerability management, such as vulnerability scanning, knowledge of exploitation, and system hardening.

### Threat Intelligence Analyst
Receiving and reporting on intelligence about newly released vulnerabilities or vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild and by which threat actors. Intelligence Analysts will usually have access to commercial tools that allow them to observe exploitation activity on a global scale, as well as underground discussions about vulnerabilities, helping the vulnerability analysts to prioritize which issues need to be fixed first. 

### Vulnerability Analyst
Identifying, reporting on, and helping to remediate vulnerable assets to harden the state and reduce risk from cyber attacks. Daily tasks include vulnerability scanning, analyszing results, perfroming manual checks, reporting on security flaws, and keeping up-to-date with the latest pubilcly available news regarding vulnerabilitites, as well as receiving threat intelligence reports from intelligence Analysts. 

### Incident Responder
Knowledge about vulnerabilities and how to deal with compromises as a result of successful exploitation is key to knowing how to respond in the most effective way. 

### Penetration Tester / Red Teamer
Knowing how to identify and scan for vulnerabilities and security flaws is key to this role, allowing you to exploit systems and gain access for security purposes, reporting on these so that Vulnerability Analysts can work with stakeholders to get the system remediated. 

# A day in the life
I was previously responsible for ensuring that thousands of endpoints around the world, including servers, websites, workstations, networking equipment, IoT, and mobile devices, stay secure. Sounds like fun, right? Hmmm... yeah. 

I'm kidding - I loved it. In this role, you get a perfect mix of the Red and Blue teams. You get to hack stuff, but they get it fixed so some nasty threat actor can't do the same thing. 

Over the past year, we've had some pretty nasty vulnerabilities. The most important has been CVE-2019-0708, a Zero-day vulnerability in Windows RDP. This remote code execution vulnerability could allow a hacker to bypass any authentication over RDP and connect directly to a system over the internet without valid credentials. This was BIG. I read some of the first public announcements on Twitter and immediately set up some Tweetdeck columns to monitor for keywords such as CVE-2-019-0708, RDP, zero-day, and Bluekeep. I turned to the other analysts in the Vulnerability Management team and said, guys, take a look at this, and sent them the details. At this point, we genuinely laughed because we knew this would be huge, and we'd update and inform the SOC manager and SecOps Director. Next, we drafted up an email notification that is going to essentially every department we have, informing them to apply the MS-issued security patches for everything mentioned and that if anything didn't need RDP open, disable the service ASAP. We go out global DMZa patched the same day, and people began queueing patches for internal assets. Over the next few days, we ran vulnerability scans against our internet-facing systems to see if RDP was still present anywhere. Other OSINT sources like Shodan helped us check for exposure. Throughout the week, we also had threat intelligence analysts looking to see if any Public Exploit code or exploits were detected in the wild. I also shared any intelligence I discovered via a government-owned information-sharing platform. 

Although such events aren't common, there's always work to do. Researching publicly announced vulnerabilities, checking them against the estate, getting systems patched, vulnerability scanning, manually checking and exploiting vulnerabilities, threat simulation attacks, analyzing reports generated by OSINt sources such as SHodan and ShadowServer, communicating with teams in other organizations, helping investigate SIEM alerts regarding vulnerability/system exploitation, web-app pen-testing our sites, and much more. 

# Getting a Job
To start, it's worth mentioning that this is all my own opinion and is not a definitive guide to landing a job as a Vulnerability Analyst. SBTY nor myself are not endorsed by any companies/websites/services mentioned on this page; they're just good at what they do. Take this as some friendly advice based on my experiences and the thoughts of my fellow analysts.

If you think a Vulnerability analyst role sounds interesting and you want to try to land a job in this position, then below is some advice including skills to focus on experiences to gain, and other ways you can potentially improve your chances. 

### Soft Skills
- Communication: this one is super important. You're going to be communicating with a lot of people in this role, including your own team, the wider security team, stakeholders from essentially every department, management, and even other organizations. You should have a high level of written and verbal communication, and be able to pass technical information to non-technical audiences in a a way that they can understand.
- Analytical: You should be analytical, which means you're good at problem-solving as well as collecting and analyzing information. An example of this is when you receive the output from a vulnerability scanner. You should be able to interpret the results and understand what the report is telling you so you can work to prioritize remediation.
- Teamwork: This a pretty obvious one, but as mentioned above you're potentially going to be working with a lot of people, and you need to be able to work effectively together, in some cases in very pressured and fast-paced situations.
- Time Management: if you're going to be responsible for conducting vulnerability scans, you need to be very skilled in time management. Not only do you need to find the best time to scan, but you'll also need to make sure you keep everyone updated with vulnerabilities that are being exploited in the wild, co-ordinating remediation activities and other tasks that require time to be planned efficiently.

### Security Related Knowledge
If you haven't already worked in a security position, there are some things you can do to boost your knowledge, and skills and look better in a hiring manager's eyes. 

- Getting hands-on with vulnerability scanners such as Nessus, OpenVas and Nikto. This shows that you understand how these tools work, who to conduct vulnerability scans, and what their outputs look like. You can get an experience like this by downloading the Metaspoitable 2 internationally vulnerability virtual machine downloading other vulnerable virtual machines from VulnHub, or scanning machines on penetration testing platforms such as Hack the Box.

- Show that you keep up-to-date with the latest security news, especially surrounding vulnerabilities. You can do this by using platforms such as TweetDeck to monitor for terms such as Vulnerability, CVE, and other phrases that will show tweets regarding vulnerabilities and exploitation.

- Having a blog with hacking write-ups or GitHub with custom tools. These will both go a long way when trying to get your first job in security or even move up the ladder. Running a blog, shows that you are motivated and driven, something that is very attractive in employees. Writing up how you hacked or owned machines on HackTheBox is a great activity and shows that you understand how to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. With up tasks. Create your own 



# CVE and CVSS scores
CVEs and CVSS scores are two things you'll hear a lot about when dealing with vulnerabilities. They help us to share information regarding security issues and rate them using a scale from Low to Critical using numerical values based on a large number of factors. This lesson will quickly cover what they are and why they're really important to us. 

### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures and is a way to standardize names for publicly known vulnerabilities. I like to think of CXVEs working like domain names. Everyone knows google.com but most people don't know the website IP. We use Google.com because it's convenient, easy to remember, and easy to use. The same pages for CVEs. I know that CVE-2019-0708 is assigned to RDP zero-day remote code execution vulnerability name BlueKeep. It makes life easier when talking about vulnerabilities, or sharing information between different vulnerability databases, tools, and services. The term CVE, which is copyrighted by MITRE, states that CVE Entries are comprised of an identification number, a description, and at least one public reference.
